Background

Geographic Information System is a system that provides on spatial data that is data about the spatial, most people do not really - really understand what that data using spatial reference, therefore we will discuss about what the spatial data and parts - parts

What is a Spatial Data?

Spatial data is spatial data is data in the form of graphics that represent space, location or places on the earth's surface. Spatial data is described by points, lines, and polygons. The attribute data is data that gives an explanation or description of any object on the earth's surface. Data attributes are used to describe the symptoms of the topography because it has a descriptive and qualitative aspects.

Data are facts about an object, event, and activity expressed by the value (number, characteristics, symbols). The types of the SIG is the spatial data and attribute data. Another example of spatial data between the location of a region, a position on the country's oil resources, and others - others. The forms of spatial data: a period (dot), for example: the position of the terminal; line (poly line), for example adalaha highway network; and area (polygon), for example, sub-districts. an example of the attribute data eg rising population in an area, soil type, etc.
Forms of attribute data is quantitative data (numbers / statistics), for example, the number of residents in an area with qualitative data (quality / grade), for example, Soil fertility rate.
Spatial data is divided into two, namely:

RASTER DATA
In each location raster data model is described as a position of the cell. These cells are grouped in the form of columns and rows of cells and so-called grid. Or in other words, the raster data model can display, placing and storing spatial data using a matrix structure or pixels that make up the grid. Each pixel or cell has its own attributes, including unique coordinates. In each matrix row contains a number of cells that have a specific value that describes a geographical phenomenon. Value therein represented by a cell is a number that indicates the nominal data. The accuracy of the data model is also highly dependent on the resolution or pixel size on the earth's surface.


VECTOR DATA
Model vector data is data that is intended to display, placing and storing spatial data using spatial data using the following elements points - points, lines or curves and polygons and attributes - attributes. Forms - describe the basic forms of spatial data like this, and in the system of vector data model, defined by the system with a line of two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates (x, y). the vector data model, geographic elements presented in digital form visualization / presentation in hardcopy maps.
