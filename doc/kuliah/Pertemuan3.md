#Read Shapefile(.shp) With Python

#Background.
Forward of the meeting II is about is about spatial data, either vector or raster and now discuss the data format shape that can be called shapefile, can be said is a spatial data A "shapefile" usually consists of a set of files with extension ".shp", " .shx "," .dbf ", and other extensions on a same name. for that I will explain a little about this shapefile using Python.


#Content

ESRI shapefile or so-called shapefile is a common geospatial data format for geographic information system software. Developed and managed by the ESRI as a specification (almost) open for the interoperability of data between ESRI and other software products.

QGIS is the Geographic Information System (GIS) which is user friendly Open Source licensed under the GNU General Public License. QGIS is not an official project of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo). QGIS can run on Linux, Unix, Mac OSX, Windows and Android, and supports many formats and data functionality of vector, raster, and database.

From the understanding of the above, we will make calculations using Python shape can be downloaded at python.org then after you install your python install get-pip.py you can search on google and install through cmd by way of input commands in cmd if you are using Windows 'python' 'C: /get-pip.py' ' "Let's suppose you mempunyi get-pip.py file in the folder C: / then you must install pyshp, pyshp is a python library to read the file shp, to install simply by typing in cmd "python -m pip install pyshp"

Once the entire process is completed try the existing documentation on pyshp you can search on google and on your terminal can run python code as in my video below, and to sample its shp files you can download at naturalearthdata.com


#Conclusion
The conclusion of my article is that the python can read files with shp using python IDE and use the library pyshp and not just on the actual pip.py python in other programming languages ​​also exist that use a library
